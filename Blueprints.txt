Wtf is gonna happen:
Determine libraries to use and imports needed. Pygame? Not sure.
This will only be the framework for it as of now. 
Make the framework and base functionality + code layout for future adaptation.
Add in and orgranize classes and files for smooth code flow. 
Seperate classes for every object in the game. No compressing in multiple objects' code into 1 class. - RIP
One main file to run all other related classes in a domino effect.
Comment code thoroughly.
Once base framework is layed, move onto creating the actual objects and displaying them into a window.
Create maps and ways to render the maps.
TOP GOAL: Make maps render only what the viewport can see.
Queue FPS optimization
Clean up and further develope other in game objects like player, movement and animation.
Further delevope map generation and FPS optimization.
Make sure to clean code further.
Skip: loads of troubleshooting and programming.
IMPLEMENT MULTIPLAYER
Then rework all your code for it cause you dont know how it works.
